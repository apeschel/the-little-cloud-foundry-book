## Who Is This Book For?

This book is for three sets of people:

 * Application developers wanting to run code *on* Cloud Foundry
 * Dev-Ops people who want to install, maintain and manage Cloud Foundry instances
 * Developers wanting to contribute, fix bugs and hack on Cloud Foundry itself

If you are an application developer, start from the beginning of this book. If you
are a dev-ops person who is already familiar with running applications on CF, you
can skip to the "Installation" chapter.

Developers who are familiar with Cloud Foundry but want to know how to contribute
can skip to "Hacking on Cloud Foundry".

## Introduction

 > Graecum est; non legitur -- "It's Greek to me"

### What is a Platform-As-A-Service (PaaS)?

A PaaS is middleware between the low-level infrastructure (i.e. the actual
CPUs, hard-drives, RAM, etc) and the high-level applications that run on top
of the platform. The boundary between the platform and the application is
clear, but the boundary between the infrastructure and the platform is
still largely in flux.


        --------------------------
        Software-as-a-service
        --------------------------
        Platform-as-a-service
        --------------------------
        Infrastructure-as-a-service
        ---------------------------

While there are many different murky definitions of PaaS floating around the market
currently, there are a few functions that are usually the task of PaaS:

 * Deploying new code to your application
 * Allocating application services + resources dynamically
 * Application health monitoring
 * Load balancing

## What is Cloud Foundry?

The name "Cloud Foundry" can be used to refer to either the
commercial VMware product at cloudfoundry.com or the Cloud Foundry Open Source
Project. In this book, "Cloud Foundry" will always refer to the open source
project, unless otherwise noted.

Cloud Foundry consists of a large amount of Ruby code along with a small amount
of C, and shell scripts that run on top of Ubuntu LTS. The C code (Warden)
is used to manage Linux containers at the kernel level using a similar strategy
as the Linux kernel user space program "lxc". CF also consists of many
configuration files in YAML format.

The vmc client is written in Ruby and speaks JSON to a Cloud Foundry-compatible
HTTP endpoint.  It is at this layer which many companies are competing for your
business. Thankfully, almost all have free for non-commercial use, academic,
non-profit and other free tiers, so you can "test drive" their flavor of the
cloud before forking over your money.

A common misconception is that VMWare Cloud Foundry needs to be run on VMware
infrastructure. That is not the case. While VMware vCloud is supported, Amazon
(and compatible APIs) are also supported out of the box.

## Deploying your App to a Cloud Foundry Instance

If you just want to deploy apps to a Cloud Foundry instance, you just need to install
a single Ruby gem called "vmc"

    gem install vmc

At this point you need to decide which Cloud Foundry based service to use. There are
many. For now, if you want to register a free account at cloudfoundry.com, you can
do that from the command line:

    vmc register
    vmc login
    vmc info

## How Do I Choose a Cloud Foundry Provider?

This question depends on these questions in the following order:

 * Do you need complete privacy?
 * Do you want to DIY it or pay somebody else to worry?
 * Which languages do I need supported?
 * Do I need value-add services such as dynamic scaling?

In theory, you can run Cloud Foundry on servers nested inside a Faraday cage in
your basement.  You would have a totally isolated private cloud. The opposite
side of the spectrum is paying for Cloud Foundry, as a service. Since Cloud Foundry
is IaaS-neutral, i.e. it doesn't care whether you run it on Amazon or some
other infrastructure. Somewhere in the middle of this spectrum is running it
on shared hosting, shared clouds, private clouds and hybrid clouds.

If you, for instance, need to be HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act) or PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
compliant, complete isolation and privacy is required. But if you are writing a
social-networking web application, running in a shared cloud environment is
perfectly reasonable.

At this point, you will know if you need to be private or not-private. Now you
will need to choose a provider that supports the set of languages that you
want.  For instance, currently only ActiveState Stackato support Perl 5, so if
you want to use Perl, your current only option is to run your own cloud or use
Stackato.  On the other hand, both AppFog and Paas.io support PHP, so you could
choose between either. New Cloud Foundry based startups and forks are being
announced almost weekly, so the options are constantly changing.

The last question to answer is the need for value-add services such as
auto-scaling.  Auto-scaling is the process of the application being monitored
and dynamically scaled as needed. For instance, usually your web app is fine
with a single PostgreSQL database and a single web server. But then you get
Slashdot'ed! (The author does not read Reddit). Auto-scaling would spin up as
many slave read-only database servers, load balancers and web servers to handle
the tsunami of traffic. When the traffic spike is over, auto-scaling reduces
the number of servers to the needed amount. This process, if it works right,
can greatly reduce costs, since you only need to pay for virtualized hardware
when you actually need it. If you had to own the physical hardware to support
your highest traffic spike, your resources would sit around unused most of the
time.

## Installation

### Simplest

ActiveState Stackato provides the easiest way to get a working Cloud Foundry
instance running locally. There is a single, simple, beautiful command which
takes care of everything, including creating a pristine VM:

    curl get.stackato.com/microcloud | bash

This should pop up a VM running inside virtualbox which has Stackato running!
You can then connect to the web interface at TODO.

### From Github

On a 64bit Ubuntu LTS (10.04.2 works well) with at least 1GB RAM

    sudo apt-get install openssh-server curl
    bash < <(curl -s -k -B http://git.io/vcap_dev_setup)

But alas, vcap_dev_setup does not actually start your local Cloud Foundry
instance, to do that you must:

    ~/cloudfoundry/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev start

To see the status of your local instance:

    ~/cloudfoundry/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev status

To target vmc at your newly started local CF instance type:

    vmc target api.vcap.me

### Deploying Cloud Foundry Instances

There is very good documenation in the the Cloud Foundry oss-docs repository
about [single and multi node vcap
deployments](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/oss-docs/tree/master/vcap/single_and_multi_node_deployments_with_dev_setup),
so I will not repeat that here. There is also a very newly released tool
called BOSH which can be used to manage one or many Cloud Foundry installations.
But alas, this tool needs a book itself. Keep an eye out for the Little BOSH Book.

## How To Contribute

Many individuals and companies have contributed to Cloud Foundry to make it
what it is today. Things that were added by the community include Python, PHP, Rack,
JRuby, Erlang and many other features and services.

In the past, VMware was overwhelmed with Github pull requests, so some of them
went seemingly ignored.  This is explained by the fact that it was VMware's
practice to sync from their private Gerrit repositories to their public Github
mirror roughly monthly which greatly increases the likelihood of merge
conflicts. Many pull requests were greatfully merged, but the waves of code
would not stop.

To the delight of many, a public Gerrit instance was recently announced. This
allows internal VMware CF developers and external CF developers to work
together, in public, which is a huge step in the right direction for VMware.
http://reviews.cloudfoundry.org Developers can sign in with OpenID or a Google
Account and participate in the development of Cloud Foundry.

The following diagram is a rough outline of how the Cloud Foundry open source
community works:

![Cloud Foundry Community Process](title_medium.png)

# Hacking on Cloud Foundry

First, I highly encourage you to install the extremely handy Gerrit
command-line gem :

    gem install gerrit-cli

You may need sudo if you are installing into your system gem location.
Now, you should have a gerrit binary in your PATH and so you can use
it to clone the central Cloud Foundry Git repository, "vcap" :

    # USERNAME is your Gerrit username, which could be different
    # than your local username
    gerrit clone ssh://USERNAME@reviews.cloudfoundry.org:29418/vcap
    # make some coffee, enjoy it, come back

    # If you have RVM, it will ask if you trust the .rvmrc
    cd vcap

    git submodule update --init --recursive

The last command above tells Git to recursively clone all the dependent
repositories and "mount" them at the proper place in the directory structure.
These dependent repos are vcap-services, vcap-tests, vcap-test-assets,
vcap-java, acm and uaa. vcap-test-assets is a nested Git submodule, inside of
vcap-tests.

## Submitting Pull Requests

Cloud Foundry does not accept pull requests on Github, it is used purely
as a mirror, for "Github cruisers". All contributions need to be made on
the public Gerrit at <http://reviews.cloudfoundry.org>.

For a more detailed explanation of the contribution process, read the Open
Source Developer
[workflow](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/oss-docs/blob/master/workflow.md)

One issue with this is that you need to sign away your intellectual property to
VMWare when you sign their Contributor License Agreement. This leaves much to
be desired and so an open source community fork called Cloud Free Style is
being formed. You can join the newly-created mailing list at [here](http://groups.google.com/group/cloudfreestyle) .

## Running Tests

All tests in Cloud Foundry are run with the Ruby `rake` tool.

    rake spec         # Run specs
    rake spec:rcov    # Run specs using RCov
    rake tests        # Run integration tests.

## Getting Help In Realtime-ish

There is a Cloud Foundry IRC channel on Freenode at #cloudfoundry. If you
need help with Gerrit, there is also a very friendly community in #gerrit
to help you.

# App Portability

"App portability" is the concept that your application should be not locked
into a single vendor. Your application should be portable in the sense that
you can take it and run it on any PaaS provider of your choosing.

To help this, Ingy has created a curated [app gallery](https://github.com/Cloud-Apps) on Github .
The goal is to fork projects into this Github organization and then keep track
of the changes necessary to get it to run on each Paas.

## Glossary

### ACM

Access Control Manager. A general system for implementing access control
features for applications.

### [BOSH](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh)

BOSH Outer SHell is an abstraction layer, between the Iaas and the Paas. It has
a pluggable architecture and currently supports Amazon and VMWare vCloud.

### caldecott

A Ruby gem which allows you to "tunnel" into the various services attached
to your application. As an example, you can use caldecott to connect to
the mysql command-line of your application running in the cloud with a
command similar to

    vmc tunnel mysql-12345

### cloud controller

The Cloud Controller can be thought of as the maestro or orchestrator. It
also includes the endpoints which vmc communicates with.

### [chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/)

Chef is an open-source systems integration framework to automate cloud-related tasks.

### DEA

Droplet Execution Agent. A process which manages the running application instances.

### dev-ops

The boundary layer between development and operations is referred to as
"dev-ops". It is characterized by the best practices of operations and
development coming together, TODO: EXAMPLE.

### droplet

An application, along with all dependencies, in a compressed archive file.

### [gerrit](https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/)

A code review tool based on Git. Gerrit was originally written for the Android
Open Source Project at Google and allows many kinds of complex requirements and
business rules to be taken into account when reviewing code.

### health

Applications can exhibit different states of "health" which include:

- running
- stopped
- flapping
- restarting

### health manager

The subsystem of CF which monitors the health of applications and classifies
them into a certain number of "states", such as "healthy" or "stopped".

### IAAS

Infrastructure-as-a-service. This is the layer below Platform-as-a-service. An example
is Amazon EC2, which takes care of the "infrastructure" of the actual physical
hardware.

### lxc

Linux "containers" which are similar to FreeBSD "jails". They allow many
"virtual" instances of Linux to run inside of a "host" Linux, which is
actually running on hardware. These have been available in the mainline
Linux kernel since 2.6.29.

### manifest

A Manifest is a YAML configuration file which lists various properties and
metadata about the application, such as endpoint URLs, package versions and
checksums.

### PAAS

Platform-as-a-service. Examples of this are Cloud Foundry, OpenShift, Rackspace,
Google App Engine and many more.

### router

The Router takes HTTP requests and sends them to the appropriate running
application instance.  It usually sits behind one or more load balancers.

### [rvm](https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm)

Ruby Version Manager. A utitity which makes it simple to manage many different
versions of Ruby as well as isolating the dependencies on a per-project level.

I highly recommend using rvm to isolate the Ruby that Cloud Foundry wants
(currently 1.9.2-p180), versus what your system Ruby is, which you should most
likely leave alone. RVM solves exactly the same problem as the virtualenv tool
solves in Python as well as the perlbrew utiltiy for Perl 5.

### stager

The stager takes an application, which is often a directory of files on disk, and
turns it into a package that can be deployed to an application instance as part
of an update or initial deploy.

### Ubuntu LTS

Long-term supported releases of Ubuntu are supported for 2 years by Canonical.
Currently it is the 12.04, which means 10.04, a widely-deployed version of Ubuntu,
is recently unsupported.

### [UAA](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa)

User Account and Authentication. UAA uses OpenID Connect for authentication
(also known as Single Sign On) and the OAuth2 protocol for granting access to
resources.

### [vcap](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap)

VMware's Cloud Application Platform. This is the central Git repository which
contains the Cloud Foundry codebase.

### vcloud

VMWare's IaaS which is comprised of various VMWare products together with a
vCloud API.

### [vmc](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vmc)

Stands for "VMware Cloud" or "VMware controller" or whatever you want it to mean,
really. It is a ruby gem which is the command-line client to endpoints which
implement the Cloud Foundry API.

### [warden](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap/tree/master/warden)

Warden is the Cloud Foundry security and isolation subsystem. It manages Linux
containers, including their creation, destruction and monitoring. It can be
thought of as a delicious layer of Ruby on top of a bit of C which uses Linux
kernel hooks to strictly enforce resource limits and manage virtualized Linux
instances on a "host" Linux server.
